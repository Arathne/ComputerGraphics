# MACH

## Philosophy 

MACH is a state machine designed for all purpose use. Designed to take CPU time out of Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 with C++11. 
Shaders are a thing of the past with these new experimental programs designed to teach pseudo code to ALL of Computer Graphics.
Now is the time to start your engines!
